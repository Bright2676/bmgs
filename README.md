# Bright's Modular Gun System (BMGS)
## A modular weapon system for Roblox that is easy to implement and modify to your needs.

## How to Use
It's simple. Using the example gun file (rbxm) linked in this page, import it into your game.
Then, open the explorer tab specifically for the gun and locate the 'Config' and 'Sounds' folders.
You may modify the values and IDs to your needs.

## Contributing
I'm not allowing for direct contributions as of right now. I want to continue the "extended" development of the system so that it can be more modular and eventually become
publicly available on the Roblox Toolbox.

## Bug Reports
To report a bug, just DM me on Discord at `@bright2676` with your bug, how you can reproduct it (if you can figure it out), and any additional notes you may have.
